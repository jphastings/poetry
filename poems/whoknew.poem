Who Knew? - Cy Densham - |__ - (24th Oct 2008 00:21)
Shattered panes of understanding
This is not how things should be!
Self comprehension denied at once
Why try my hand at this?

For days and days I've been so sure,
Chemistry a simple slave,
Yet intellect provides no cure
When impulse be my bride.

Come seven hours or twenty minutes
(Confused minds know half as much)
My tongue shall speak a different name
And pray not know the change.
