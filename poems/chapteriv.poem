Chapter IV - Cy Densham - _|_ - (20th October 2009)
Shadows in the fading blue -
Serenity, for a while, is yours
But her depth is still beyondâ€¦

The world, distant from below,
Is encircled by yet more of it;
Three letters belie sheer strength. 

Hidden mysteries abound,
Originator of life itself.
Have you had enough today?
