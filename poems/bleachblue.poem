Bleach-Blue - Cy Densham - |__ - (14th March 2007) - Date is right I think (Easter holidays first year of Nottingham, during trip to Morocco)
grains of sand rolling,
waves re-tumbling again
jazz plays softly

two suns wane
sky and sea smudge.

minds pass through
few stay, for long -
yet remain

microcosm of life
time stands still once more
