		<h1>Oh dear</h1>
		<h2>You seem to be using Internet Explorer</h2>
		<p>I'm going to be straight with you. Internet Explorer is one of the big black misery holes in my life. I don't really have time to make my little web projects fit in with Microsoft's need to adhere to their own standards, rather than the ones set by the international 'world wide web consortium' (or w3c). Internet Explorer (even IE8, the latest version) is the <em>only</em> modern browser that doesn't display SVG images, which is exactly what Project Prime depends on. Seeing as you're using internet explorer you wouldn't see anything at all!</p>
		<p>I do apologise that you can't view our creation in your browser, but please, <strong>please</strong> consider moving to a browser that doesn't make web developers' lives hell! <a href="http://getfirefox.com">Mozilla's Firefox</a>, <a href="http://apple.com/safari">Apple's Safari</a>, <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google's Chrome</a> and <a href="http://opera.com/download">Opera</a> are all superlative browsers and they all will get you viewing Project Prime the way it's supposed to look.</p>
		
		<p>Many thanks,<br/>Cy Densham</p>
